hi :) my neural nextwork task is in the file called "cnn.py" and the chatbot is in "app.py"

my chatbot worked perfectly fine while I was running it locally but for some reason streamlit refused to recognise the Groq API Key that I had put in the .streamlit/secrets.toml file, so I tried directly putting it into my code and now streamlit is still running the old code for some reason?  

But here's screenshots of the chatbot actually working
